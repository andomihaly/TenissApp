Low level bugs

Integration bugs
- if there is no winner GetWinner add "X" not exception

High level bugs
- If GetCurrrentScore is not call we can't recognize that we win the set

Clean Code issues:
- IsMatchOver
    + minimumWinningSet name desinformation
    + minimumWinningSet/2  -> do you have enough winned set algoritm
- Everything in One Class -> practice "SOLID"
