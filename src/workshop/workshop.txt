Clean Code issues:
- Everything in One Class -> practice "SOLID"
SOLID design:

- ScoreFollower - ScorePrinter - UI (see the current status and the score of the tennis match)
- Player - PlayTennis - (play the game and A or B win the Game)
- Ruler  - TennisMatch - (organize the tennis match, control the match until end)
                       - (collect and store each game during the tennis match)
- Scorer - CalculateTennisScore - (calculate the score from the wins)


Next Feature:
Store the game point for old sets.
