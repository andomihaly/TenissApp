Low level bugs
- Match (Best of Three / Five) is not implemented properly - can be any best of four...

Integration bugs
- GetWinner input is minimumWinningSet (which is ok because in here we need 2 or 3 see clean code issues), but here is a missing function which is set the type of tennis game before start
- if there is no winner GetWinner add "X" not exception

High level bugs
- If GetCurrrentScore is not call we can't recognize that we win the set

Clean Code issues:
- IsMatchOver
    + minimumWinningSet name desinformation
    + minimumWinningSet/2  -> do you have enough winned set algoritm
- Everything in One Class -> practice "SOLID"
